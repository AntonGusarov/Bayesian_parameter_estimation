# Bayesian parameter estimation

Reproduced the results published in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08211) where the parameters of a toy effective field theories models are estimated using the Bayesian inference.

**Predictions made by the Bayesian regression model.** *Left:* model with the flat prior. *Right:* model with the natural (Gaussian) prior:

**Distribution of the estimated model parameters.** *Left:* posteriors pdfs with flat prior. *Right:* posterior pdfs with natural (Gaussian) prior. The joint pdfs are on the lower triangle plots, marginalized histograms for each parameter on the diagonal:

Within the Bayesian framework it becomes possible to naturally incorporate the prior knowledge about the phenomenon of interest in our models including expectations as well as the uncertainties in experimental data.
